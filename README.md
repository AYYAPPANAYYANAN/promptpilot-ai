# 🚀 PromptPilot AI

PromptPilot AI automatically converts **casual human input into professional AI prompts as an internal execution step**, then runs the AI and returns accurate results with **multilingual voice output**.

Users never need to know how to write prompts.

## ✨ What Problem Does This Solve?

Most people don’t know how to prompt AI properly.  
Bad prompts lead to bad results.

PromptPilot fixes this by adding an **internal prompt-optimization layer** that works automatically during execution.

The professional prompt is an **intermediate process inside the system**, not something the user has to write.
